quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

###Q3.  More List Files in Unix

ls -R   Recursive. Also list files in subdirectories.

###Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

xargs is used to build and run a command line using standard input.  Many key linux commands (like awk and grep) will take the standard input as a parameter by using a pipe.

Example:
echo a b c d e f| xargs -p -n 3
/bin/echo a b c ?...y
/bin/echo d e f ?...a b c
y
d e f
